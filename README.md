# states
C code to implement table driven state machines for embedded systems

All software is implicitly a state machine.

I prefer an explict definition, but using named states makes following
state flow and documenting it a problem. So a simple definition is better
and adding a few common, frequently used basic states helps.

This is designed to be used with no-OS, run to completion type systems.
